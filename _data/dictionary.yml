cause_of_action: The grounds on which the Plaintiff is suing the Defendant. A Plaintiff will win their lawsuit if they can satisfactorily prove all of the elements of their chosen cause of action.
chattel: Personal property, which is everyone someone owns except for cash, real property (like land or houses), and intellectual property (like patents and trademarks).
comparative_fault: In lawsuits for neglient actions, you may consider to what degree you believe the plaintiff is responsible, and adjust your award proportionally. For instance, you may award $70 on a $100 claim if you believe the defendant was 70% responsible and the plaintiff was 30% responsible.
conversion:
  - The plaintiff owned or had the right to possess the property;
  - The defendant substantially interfered, took possession, prevented access, destroyed, or refused to return the property;
  - The defendant's actions were intentional and authorized; and
  - The act indefinitely deprived the plaintiff of their property.
character_propensity: Evidence or testimony about a person's character or personality traits is inadmissible when used to suggest that the person has a greater propensity or is more likely to have done something they are accused of.
hearsay: Generally, a statement is inadmissible if it is both a) made outside of the courtroom, and b) offered as evidence to prove that the content of the statement is true (e.g. offering the out-of-court statement, "it's raining" to prove that it was raining). There are many exceptions to the general rule of hearsay.
negligence:
  - The defendant should have, and failed to, exercise reasonable care toward the plaintiff or their property;
  - The plaintiff suffered recognizable damages from personal injury or impairment to their property; and
  - The damages were a reasonably forseeable outcome of the defendant's actions.
opinion: Speculation, such as  is usually iadmissible, 
relevance: Testimony must be relevant to proving or disproving the Cause of Action to be admissible. The threshold for relevance is lenient; as long as a statement is reasonably probative of a consequential fact, it can be admitted.
standard_of_evidence: In civil court, cases are decided "by a preponderance of the evidence". This is a lesser standard than "beyond a reasonable doubt", which is used in criminal court. The Plaintiff has the burden of proof, and prevails if you rule that it is more likely than not &mdash; in other words, that there is a greater than 50% chance &mdash; that their story is true.
statement_by_party_opponent: (Hearsay Exception) Statements made by the opposing party are not hearsay, and are admissible as evidence.
trespass_to_chattel:
  - The plaintiff owned or had the right to possess the property;
  - The defendant damaged the property, or interfered with its ownership or enjoyment;
  - The damage or interference was intentional and unauthorized; and
  - The plaintiff suffered damages from the property's impairment or loss of use.
