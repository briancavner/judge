cause_of_action: The grounds on which the Plaintiff is suing the Defendant. A Plaintiff will win their lawsuit if they can satisfactorily prove all of the elements of their chosen cause of action.
character_propensity: Evidence or testimony about a person's character or personality traits is inadmissible when used to suggest that the person has a greater propensity or is more likely to have done something they are accused of.
hearsay: Generally, a statement is inadmissible if it is both a) made outside of the courtroom, and b) offered as evidence to prove that the content of the statement is true (e.g. offering the out-of-court statement, "it's raining" to prove that it was raining). There are many exceptions to the general rule of hearsay.
relevance: Testimony must be relevant to proving or disproving the Cause of Action to be admissible.
standard_of_evidence: In civil court, cases are decided "by a preponderance of the evidence". This is a lesser standard than "beyond a reasonable doubt", which is used in criminal court. The Plaintiff has the burden of proof, and prevails if you rule that it is more likely than not &mdash; in other words, that there is a greater than 50% chance &mdash; that their story is true.
statement_by_party_opponent: An exception to the rule of hearsay. Statements made by the opposing party are not hearsay, and are admissible as evidence.
