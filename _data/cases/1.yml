complaint:
  - I am a long-time resident of Flourishing Fields, and a respected member of the community. The defendant, Ms. Heiferson, is my neighbor and former friend.
  - On the evening of October 11, I invited Ms. Heiferson and several other community members to a [[social gathering|gathering]] at my pen. The farm was going to elect a new livestock representative, and I wanted to run, so I was having a little campaign party to get the support of my friends.
  - About two hours into the event, we had just had dinner, and Ms. Heiferson went to the [[manure grate|grate]]. She was in there for [[twenty minutes|time]], and I heard a loud crack while she was using it. When she came out I asked if everything was alright, and she said yes but she looked guilty. I [[discovered later|later]] when another guest tried to use the grate that it had been broken.
  - I confronted Ms. Heiferson about it and she denied breaking my grate. I told her I didn't believe her, and she starting making a scene. When I asked her to leave, she said some very nasty things to me and stormed out.
  - The evening at that point was pretty much ruined and everyone left shortly after her. I was so embarassed.
  - I got an estimate to fix my manure grate the next day. It cost $260, and I believe Ms. Heiferson is responsible because she is the one who broke the grate.
response:
  - I recently moved next door to the plaintiff, Ms. Swineman, at the Flourishing Fields Farm. She was immediately a headache, constantly complaining about noise, or that we would leave things leaning against the fence. She has a bit of a reputation.
  - So then on October 11, I'm in my yard enjoying a milkshake when Ms. Swineman comes up and says the nastiest things to me. Not unusual, but not something I feel like hearing that day, so I go back inside.
  - The next time I saw her was that night when she came over and said I had broken her feeding trough, as if I would ever want to touch that disgusting thing. So I told her that I wouldn't do something like that, and she just told me that she'd see me in court, and now here we are.
  - I have no interest in breaking any of Ms. Swineman's things. I'd prefer she just leave me alone.
questioning:
  plaintiff:
    gathering:
      - j: Was this the first time you hosted a social gathering?
      - p: No, I have had them all over before, multiple times &mdash; Ms. Heiferson included.
      - p: There had never been an issue before. We had always gotten along fine.
    grate:
      - j: Tell me about your manure grate.
      - p: It's a typical manure grate, same as the ones in all the other pens in the farm.
      - p: I never had an issue with it before. Ms. Heiferson has even used it.
      - p: But I guess that was before she put on some weight.
    time:
      - j: Did you keep a stopwatch running while she was using your manure grate, Ms. Swineman?
      - p: No, nothing like that, Your Honor.
      - p: But I heard the crack right after she went in there, so I was waiting for her to come out, and I happened to notice how long she took.
    later:
      - j: If you thought Ms. Heiferson had broken your manure grate, why didn't you check it right away?
      - p: I wanted to, but I was busy hosting the party, Your Honor. Cooking and entertaining at the same time.
      - p: I planned to check as soon as I could pull myself away, but another guest went to the grate about 10 minutes later and then came right out and got me.
      - p: She said that my manure grate was broken, and that she thought it looked like someone had smashed it.
        inadmissible:
          type: hearsay
          weight: 3
          convo:
            - j: Don't tell me what she thought or what she said unless she's here to speak for herself.
            - j: Tell me what you did, and what you saw.
            - p: I went to look at the manure grate and saw that it was broken. No one else had used it after Ms. Heiferson.
      - p: So I went in and checked, and sure enough, it was broken. No one had used it after Ms. Heiferson.
