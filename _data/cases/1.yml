complaint:
  - I am a [[long-time resident|resident]] of [[Flourishing Fields|flourishing]], and a [[respected member|respected]] of the community. The defendant, Ms. Heiferson, is my [[neighbor]], and she is someone with whom I have [[never been able to get along|get_along]] despite my [[best efforts|best_efforts]].
  - On the night of October 11, I was taking my piglets for an evening walk. We came home, and I put my piglets to bed. I felt a craving for a snack before bed, as is common for anyone, and went out to the trough. I found it smashed in multiple places, clearly intentionally.
  - I knew right away that Ms. Heiferson had done it. She's jealous of me, and told me that she would do something like this. When I confronted her, she lied about it.
  - In her rampage, she not only destroyed the trough itself, but also the housing it sits in. I'm suing for a replacement trough and to have the housing repaired, which costs $160 in total.
response:
  - I recently moved next door to the plaintiff, Ms. Swineman, at the Flourishing Fields Farm. She was immediately a headache, constantly complaining about noise, or that we would leave things leaning against the fence. She has a bit of a reputation.
  - So then on October 11, I'm in my yard enjoying a milkshake when Ms. Swineman comes up and says the nastiest things to me. Not unusual, but not something I feel like hearing that day, so I go back inside.
  - The next time I saw her was that night when she came over and said I had broken her feeding trough, as if I would ever want to touch that disgusting thing. So I told her that I wouldn't do something like that, and she just told me that she'd see me in court, and now here we are.
  - I have no interest in breaking any of Ms. Swineman's things. I'd prefer she just leave me alone.
